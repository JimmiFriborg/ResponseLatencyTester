# Hardware Latency Tester v4.0

## 🚀 Highlights
- **Media & Timeline Overhaul** – Frame-accurate HTML5 playback, keyboard-driven scrubbing, and unified HH:MM:SS:FF timecode unlock surgical review across 30/60/120 FPS footage.
- **Integrated Marker Workbench** – Zoomable timeline + waveform overlays, eight marker types, and inspector tooling let analysts annotate, compare, and export without leaving the app.
- **Pattern Intelligence** – Template training, FFT audio analysis, and auto-detection pipelines accelerate repetitive validation with confidence scoring and review workflows.
- **Hardware-Aware Governance** – Hardware profiles, firmware tracking, and requirement presets keep every execution tied to the correct equipment context.
- **Professional Exports** – Multi-format export suite delivers CSV, JSON, PDF (with embedded frames), and optional annotated video packages ready for leadership reviews.

## ✅ Evaluation
- **Workflow cohesion:** The 8-phase rollout drives a complete pipeline from ingest → annotation → validation → export while preserving the single-file delivery model.
- **Scalability:** IndexedDB caching, worker-based FFT analysis, and lazy loading ensure responsiveness even on multi-GB media with hundreds of markers.
- **Governance:** Hardware/profile linkage and audit history prevent drift between requirements, firmware, and captured executions.
- **Extensibility:** Architecture leaves room for future cloud sync, advanced codec support, and encrypted exports without disrupting the core experience.

Upgrade to v4.0 to streamline analysis workflows, automate detection, and deliver hardware-specific evidence packages.
